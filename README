An inplementation in Ruby/Sinatra of the login page used with 
ChilliSpot and friends.

It's been tested with CoovaChilli ( see http://coova.org/ ), which is an
actively maintained version of the original ChilliSpot (now defunct).

Inspired by hotspotlogin.cgi (written in Perl, included in ChilliSpot and 
CoovaChili) and its PHP port, hotspotlogin.php,  
found in: http://www.chillispot.info/chilliforum/viewtopic.php?pid=80#p80

Disable uamuiport option in CoovaChilli configuration!

And configure http:/<ip>:4990 as the uamserver! Where, 4990 is the default
listening port of hotspotlogin.rb .
